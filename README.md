# Keylogger-ISM
Keylogger program for independent research
This is my original work for the Independent Student Research and Mentorship Program. 
This program is a keylogger with various features which include: recording key strokes, acquiring screenshots, copying user's clipboard, recording audio, and getting user's system information.
Audio function does not fully work.
This code is still being updated and is not fully refined yet.
